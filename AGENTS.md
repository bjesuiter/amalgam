## Default Ralp-Loop Prompt 
Get the most important ticket from your perspective from beans and work on it. Work ONLY on this one ticket. 
If you realize you need to do another thing, create a new ticket for this. 
When you finish a ticket successfully, mark the ticket as done in beans and Commit and Push afterwards. 
You're done when all tickets are implemented.
