Get the most important ticket from your perspective from beans and work on it. Work ONLY on this one ticket. 
If you realize you need to do another thing, create a new ticket for this. 
When you finish a ticket successfully, mark the ticket as done in beans and Commit and Push afterwards. 

You're done when all tickets are implemented.
